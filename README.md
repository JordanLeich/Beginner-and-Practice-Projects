# Beginner-and-Practice-Projects
These are projects that were mainly made just for fun or learning.

Feel free to edit and alter my code for my projects to your liking but make sure you give me credit if you use my code.
If you wish to possibly work on something with me or request my help, feel free to email me at jordanleich@gmail.com
